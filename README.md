# **YTCR Remake (name is also a WIP)**
Unleash channel points and channel rewards on your YouTubeâ„¢ and Twitch streams, just like how you do on Twitch with our powerful extension!
## How To Install
This extension should work with Chromium-based browser. That includes Chrome, Edge, and Brave.

The link to download the newest main version is here: https://github.com/ZLGNF/YTCRemake/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

Once extracted into a folder, you can go here to load it: chrome://extensions/

Ensure you have Developer Mode enabled; then you can just load the extension via the load unpacked button and selecting the folder you extracted the files to.

You're ready to start using it, at least on my channel.
## How To Use
Inside the commands folder there is a commands.xml file. This file contains my own commands and should work as baseline for streamers to create their own version following a similar blueprint.

Once that file is created, they have to be named after the channel ID (for Youtube) or name (for Twitch). 
For example, if you want to see the commands of https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnzGxHoqeD69OQjnf0oUhtw you need to have a UCnzGxHoqeD69OQjnf0oUhtw.xml file.

The idea is for each streamer to create their own file and anyone with this extension can download it and put inside the commands folder. The folder can have as many files as you want.
